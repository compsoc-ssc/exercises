Intro
-----

This is a repository (repo) which teaches the basics.

By The Book
-----------

You can officially go through the folders in the order below
or you can jump around and learn what you like.

1. [Git](git.md)
2. [The Zen of Computing](zen.md)
3. [Algorithms](https://github.com/nryoung/algorithms)
4. [Things to do](todo.md)

Some useful links
-----------------

To someone unbaptized in the world of computing, it can be quiet
confusing. Here is a list of things you can use to make sense of things.

New terms which are thrown around a lot:

- [Request For Comment (RFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)
- [Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#Development)
- [Internet Relay Chat (IRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

Programming:

- [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
- [Vim text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29)
- [Emacs text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)
- [Sublime text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)

Operating Systems:(we prefer a unix based OS any day)

- [Ubuntu       :If you have no experience outside Windows.](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
- [Mint         :If you have some experience and want cleanliness](http://www.linuxmint.com/)
- [Manjaro      :If you want fast things on old hardware](http://manjaro.org/)
- [Archlinux    :If you want the ultimate freedom of linux](http://archlinux.org/)

Languages
---------

We like all languages. If you can do something better in a language of your choice,
do it. If you want to learn a new one [Python](http://python.org/) is preffered.

In case performance matters C or C++ is encouraged.

Competition
-----------

- What cannot be measured does not exist.
- Some places to compete are Codechef, HackerRank etc.
- Or you could compete offline and win cash at local competitions.
